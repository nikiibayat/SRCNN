Steps to run the code:
First download CelebA dataset. Then based on identities labels, create Train-Validation-Test sets in a way that you have one image from each person in Validation, One in Test and The rest in Train set. This way you should have 182289 images for training and 9809 images for validation and test.
Secondly, by using img_utils.py create X and y images for training and testing the model.
Third, Using tests.py you can train or evaluate any model that you want.
